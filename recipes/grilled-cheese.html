    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bread</strong>- a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>- use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted, but any butter will work here.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>- use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda, and havarti cheese.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Butter the toast</strong>- spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat skillet</strong>- place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275ËšF. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese</strong>- stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the toast</strong>- Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>- cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li>
    </ol>
