        the best Grilled Cheese sandwich with a crisp, buttery exterior and gooey cheese center.</p>
    <p>Try this combination of cheeses and the process for buttering and cooking the <br>
        toast and you will be known for your Grilled Cheese Sandwiches. All you need <br>
        is a <a href="./tomato-soup.html">Creamy Tomato Soup</a> to dunk your sandwich into.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices Texas toast , or thick sliced sandwich bread</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 slice medium cheddar cheese </li>
        <li>1 slice Gouda cheese</li>
        <li>1 slice Havarti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Set a skillet over medium/low heat and place 2 slices of bread in the skillet with the butter-side-down.</li>
        <li>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda. Once the breads are golden brown, <br>
            closed the sandwich with the crisp sides on the outside.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once and press down lightly<br>
            to help the bread stick to the cheese. Total cooking time should one 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat on <br>
            medium low for the breads to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to fully melt and adhere to the bread.</li>
        <li>Once you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove to a plate and cut in half diagonally<br>
            to serve. Repeat with the next sandwich.</li>
